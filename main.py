Synapic - AI-Powered Image Tagging Application
===============================================

Main entry point for the Synapic application. This application uses AI models
(local, Hugging Face, or OpenRouter) to automatically generate metadata tags
for images, including categories, keywords, and descriptions.

The application can work with:
- Local image folders
- Daminion Digital Asset Management (DAM) system

# PYTHONW COMPATIBILITY - NULL STREAM SAFETY
# ============================================================================
# When launched via pythonw.exe (e.g. from start_synapic.bat), sys.stdout and
# sys.stderr are None. This silently breaks logging.StreamHandler, print(),
# and any cleanup code that relies on logging for error reporting — causing
# memory leak fixes to be silently skipped.
# Replace None streams with devnull wrappers so all downstream code works.

# WINDOWS COMPATIBILITY - HUGGING FACE CACHE SYMLINKS
# ============================================================================
# On Windows, Hugging Face Hub tries to use symlinks for caching which requires
# Developer Mode or Administrator privileges. Setting this env var disables
# symlink warnings and tells HF Hub to copy files instead.
