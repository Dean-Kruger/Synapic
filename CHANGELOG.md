# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Synapic** project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Groq Integration**: Added full support for the Groq SDK (`groq` python package) enabling high-speed inference with models like Llama 3 and Mixtral.
- **Unified Engine Configuration**: Completely redesigned the "Select Engine" dialog in Step 2 to be the central hub for all AI providers (Local, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Groq).
- **Confidence Threshold Slider**: Implemented a configurable confidence threshold (1-100%) to filter out low-probability tags and categories from AI results.
- **Deduplication Engine**: Added a complete visual deduplication workflow (`StepDedup`) supporting perceptual hashing (pHash, dHash, etc.) to find and manage duplicate images in Daminion catalogs.
- **Process Management**: Added robust shutdown logic to ensure all background threads and processes are terminated when the application closes.

### Changed
- **Step 2 UI Overhaul**: Removed redundant "Groq Explorer" and standalone settings from the main wizard form, consolidating everything into the configuration dialog.
- **Model List Improvements**: Standardized the layout of model selection lists across all providers with consistent headers (Model ID | Capability | Cost/Size) and styling.
- **Configuration Persistence**: Optimized how API keys and engine settings are saved to `.synapic_v2_config.json`.

### Fixed
- **Daminion Search Limits**: Addressed issues where text-based searches were artificially limited to 500 items.
- **Groq API Compatibility**: Resolved issues with the Groq base URL and simplified the integration to focus on the official SDK.
- **Keyword Creation**: Fixed edge cases where existing keywords in Daminion were duplicates or not correctly identified.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Implementation of the full documentation plan. Added module-level docstrings, class/method-level Google-style docstrings, and detailed inline comments across all 23 Python modules.
- **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Integrated `GranularProgress` and `EnhancedProgressTracker` into the tagging engine for real-time, weighted progress reporting in the UI.
- **Improved UI Validation**: Red/Green status indicators for engine configuration to provide immediate feedback on API key or local model availability.

### Fixed
- **Daminion Metadata Write-back**: Added missing `update_item_metadata` method to `DaminionClient`, fixing a critical failure where AI results were not saved to the DAM.
- **Keyword Creation Logic**: Fixed issues in Daminion keyword creation where existing keywords were sometimes not correctly identified, leading to duplicate creation attempts or association failures.
- **Daminion Filter Counts**: Corrected the `get_filtered_item_count` logic to ensure accurate record counts are returned when complex filters (Keywords, Status, Date) are applied.
- **Model Download UI**: Fixed progress bar inaccuracies and added a cancel (Abort) capability during model downloads to prevent UI locks.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Complete API Rewrite**: Replaced the legacy monolithic `daminion_client.py` with a modular, official-spec `DaminionAPI` wrapper.
- **New Sub-API Modules**:
  - `MediaItemsAPI`, `TagsAPI`, `CollectionsAPI`, `ItemDataAPI`, `SettingsAPI`, `ThumbnailsAPI`, `DownloadsAPI`, `ImportsAPI`, `UserManagerAPI`.
- **Type Safety**: 100% type hint coverage across core and utility modules.
- **Daminion Integration Guides**: Created comprehensive developer guides, quick reference sheets, and migration documentation.
- **Automated Testing**: Added a suite of 11 automated tests for the Daminion integration layer.
- **Working Examples**: Added `daminion_api_example.py` with 9 production-ready usage patterns.

### Changed
- **Log Location**: Moved log output from the user home directory (`~/.synapic/logs`) to the project root (`./logs/`) for easier developer access.
- **Architecture**: Moved from a monolithic client to a modular, sub-API based architecture.

### Fixed
- **Zero Results Bug**: Fixed a filtering issue that caused search results to be incorrectly dropped during processing.
- **Excessive Error Logging**: Reduced redundant Daminion connection errors from 20+ to 0-2 per session.
- **Endpoint Accuracy**: Re-based all network calls on official Daminion Server Web API specifications (fixing multiple 404 errors).

---

## [1.x] - Legacy Implementation

### Overview
- Original reverse-engineered integration with Daminion.
- Supported basic folder-based tagging.

### Known Limitations (Fixed in v2.0)
- Monolithic `daminion_client.py` (2,300+ lines).
- Frequent 404/500 errors due to unofficial endpoint usage.
- Lack of type safety and documentation.
